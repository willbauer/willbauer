I'm Will Bauer, a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's College of Journalism and Mass Communications. I'm a studying journalism, broadcasting and sports communications. Yes, that's three majors. And, yes, I'm a nerd. 

Currently, I'm a fellow at the Omaha World-Herald. Throughout college, I've made stops at NET - Nebraska's NPR Member Station, ESPN Lincoln and the campus newspaper - the Daily Nebraskan, among other things. I'd ideally love to combine my love of audio, data and journalism into a job when I gradute in December 2020, but we'll see if that ever happens. I'm particulary interested in investigative journalism and longform podcasts. Because I'm a big nerd, I'll probably go back to grad school when I can pay for it. 

As far as my data skills, they're getting better, slowly but surely.
